maybe there's a tiny little bit of gold
in<00:00:14.700><c> there</c><00:00:14.880><c> and</c><00:00:15.719><c> and</c><00:00:16.039><c> Palladium</c><00:00:17.039><c> and</c><00:00:17.779><c> tantalum</c>

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
in there and and Palladium and tantalum
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.050 align:start position:0%

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
and rare earth metals and so on you add
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 align:start position:0%
and rare earth metals and so on you add
it<00:00:21.240><c> all</c><00:00:21.359><c> up</c><00:00:21.539><c> I</c><00:00:22.320><c> don't</c><00:00:22.380><c> know</c><00:00:22.439><c> maybe</c><00:00:22.619><c> it</c><00:00:22.800><c> comes</c><00:00:23.100><c> to</c>

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
it all up I don't know maybe it comes to
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 align:start position:0%
it all up I don't know maybe it comes to
50<00:00:23.520><c> American</c><00:00:23.880><c> dollars</c><00:00:24.840><c> okay</c><00:00:25.320><c> that's</c><00:00:25.560><c> after</c>

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
50 American dollars okay that's after

lithium<00:00:26.279><c> lithium</c><00:00:27.000><c> in</c><00:00:27.180><c> the</c><00:00:27.300><c> battery</c><00:00:27.359><c> maybe</c>

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
lithium lithium in the battery maybe
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.050 align:start position:0%
lithium lithium in the battery maybe
that<00:00:27.960><c> comes</c><00:00:28.260><c> to</c><00:00:28.439><c> 100.</c>

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
that comes to 100.
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 align:start position:0%
that comes to 100.
it<00:00:30.599><c> certainly</c><00:00:30.840><c> doesn't</c><00:00:30.960><c> come</c><00:00:31.199><c> to</c><00:00:31.380><c> the</c><00:00:31.560><c> some</c>

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
it certainly doesn't come to the some
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 align:start position:0%
it certainly doesn't come to the some
thousands<00:00:32.279><c> that</c><00:00:32.460><c> the</c><00:00:32.640><c> computer</c><00:00:32.759><c> is</c><00:00:33.059><c> worse</c>

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
thousands that the computer is worse
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 align:start position:0%
thousands that the computer is worse
right

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
right
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
right
