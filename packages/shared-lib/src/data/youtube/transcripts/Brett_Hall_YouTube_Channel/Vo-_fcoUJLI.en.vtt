00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
so the spark is about knowledge but
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.850 align:start position:0%
so the spark is about knowledge but

so the kind of culture of criticism that
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.250 align:start position:0%
so the kind of culture of criticism that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
civilization is the thing that allows us
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.590 align:start position:0%
civilization is the thing that allows us
to<00:00:15.839><c> create</c><00:00:16.160><c> knowledge</c><00:00:17.160><c> that</c><00:00:17.520><c> is</c><00:00:17.760><c> without</c>

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 align:start position:0%

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910 align:start position:0%

and<00:00:20.100><c> that</c><00:00:20.220><c> we</c><00:00:20.400><c> can</c><00:00:20.640><c> have</c><00:00:20.939><c> Cosmic</c><00:00:21.720><c> significance</c>

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
and that we can have Cosmic significance
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.429 align:start position:0%
and that we can have Cosmic significance
okay<00:00:23.279><c> so</c><00:00:23.520><c> the</c><00:00:23.699><c> spark</c><00:00:23.939><c> Begins</c><00:00:24.480><c> by</c><00:00:25.199><c> talking</c>

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay so the spark Begins by talking
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.050 align:start position:0%
okay so the spark Begins by talking
about<00:00:25.740><c> how</c><00:00:26.699><c> ancient</c><00:00:27.660><c> myths</c><00:00:28.340><c> were</c><00:00:29.340><c> largely</c>

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
about how ancient myths were largely
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 align:start position:0%
about how ancient myths were largely
anthropocentric<00:00:31.019><c> they</c><00:00:31.320><c> were</c><00:00:31.500><c> about</c><00:00:31.679><c> us</c><00:00:32.220><c> so</c>

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
anthropocentric they were about us so
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
anthropocentric they were about us so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 align:start position:0%
and what human beings were capable of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.490 align:start position:0%
doing and how the rest of reality was
here<00:00:43.739><c> for</c><00:00:43.980><c> us</c><00:00:44.219><c> was</c><00:00:44.879><c> here</c><00:00:45.120><c> to</c><00:00:45.360><c> try</c><00:00:45.540><c> and</c><00:00:45.719><c> attack</c>

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
here for us was here to try and attack
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 align:start position:0%
here for us was here to try and attack
us<00:00:46.800><c> or</c><00:00:47.219><c> here</c><00:00:47.460><c> to</c><00:00:47.640><c> try</c><00:00:47.760><c> and</c><00:00:47.940><c> preserve</c><00:00:48.360><c> Us</c><00:00:48.480><c> in</c>

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
us or here to try and preserve Us in
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
us or here to try and preserve Us in
some<00:00:48.899><c> way</c><00:00:49.100><c> so</c><00:00:50.100><c> this</c><00:00:50.640><c> idea</c><00:00:51.059><c> is</c><00:00:51.300><c> called</c>

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
some way so this idea is called
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 align:start position:0%
some way so this idea is called
anthropocentrism

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
anthropocentrism
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 align:start position:0%
anthropocentrism
so<00:00:54.239><c> let</c><00:00:54.360><c> me</c><00:00:54.539><c> begin</c><00:00:54.719><c> at</c><00:00:55.199><c> the</c><00:00:55.260><c> very</c><00:00:55.440><c> beginning</c><00:00:55.620><c> of</c>

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
so let me begin at the very beginning of
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 align:start position:0%
so let me begin at the very beginning of
chapter<00:00:56.699><c> three</c><00:00:57.059><c> and</c><00:00:57.600><c> we</c><00:00:57.840><c> will</c><00:00:58.020><c> read</c><00:00:58.199><c> through</c>

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
chapter three and we will read through
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
chapter three and we will read through
at<00:00:58.680><c> least</c><00:00:58.860><c> part</c><00:00:59.160><c> of</c><00:00:59.340><c> it</c>
