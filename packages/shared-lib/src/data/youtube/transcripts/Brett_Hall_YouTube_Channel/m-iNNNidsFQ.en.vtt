00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
times past in fact I think it actually
 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.129 align:start position:0%
times past in fact I think it actually
goes<00:00:08.580><c> beyond</c><00:00:08.910><c> that</c><00:00:09.090><c> because</c><00:00:09.330><c> there</c><00:00:09.750><c> are</c><00:00:09.780><c> many</c>

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that because there are many
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.570 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that because there are many
things<00:00:10.410><c> that</c><00:00:10.530><c> we</c><00:00:10.679><c> take</c><00:00:10.800><c> for</c><00:00:11.160><c> granted</c><00:00:11.219><c> today</c>

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
things that we take for granted today
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
things that we take for granted today
that<00:00:12.389><c> weren't</c><00:00:12.599><c> even</c><00:00:12.900><c> imagined</c><00:00:13.500><c> in</c><00:00:14.219><c> times</c><00:00:14.730><c> past</c>

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 align:start position:0%
that weren't even imagined in times past
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.450 align:start position:0%
that weren't even imagined in times past
they<00:00:15.269><c> weren't</c><00:00:15.509><c> even</c><00:00:15.660><c> in</c><00:00:15.870><c> the</c><00:00:15.929><c> realm</c><00:00:16.170><c> of</c><00:00:16.260><c> magic</c>

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 align:start position:0%
they weren't even in the realm of magic
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't even in the realm of magic
so<00:00:17.460><c> it</c><00:00:17.699><c> actually</c><00:00:17.850><c> goes</c><00:00:18.119><c> beyond</c><00:00:18.869><c> that</c><00:00:19.050><c> so</c><00:00:19.980><c> I</c>

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 align:start position:0%
so it actually goes beyond that so I
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.670 align:start position:0%
so it actually goes beyond that so I
thought<00:00:20.250><c> well</c><00:00:20.630><c> you</c><00:00:21.630><c> know</c><00:00:21.660><c> if</c><00:00:21.779><c> if</c><00:00:22.230><c> I</c><00:00:22.380><c> can</c><00:00:22.529><c> do</c>

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
thought well you know if if I can do
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.370 align:start position:0%
thought well you know if if I can do
some<00:00:23.609><c> of</c><00:00:23.640><c> those</c><00:00:23.760><c> things</c><00:00:23.820><c> basically</c><00:00:24.689><c> if</c><00:00:24.779><c> I</c><00:00:25.230><c> can</c>

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
some of those things basically if I can
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.019 align:start position:0%
some of those things basically if I can
advanced<00:00:25.769><c> technology</c><00:00:26.430><c> then</c><00:00:26.640><c> that</c><00:00:26.789><c> that's</c>

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 align:start position:0%
advanced technology then that that's
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
advanced technology then that that's
like<00:00:27.240><c> magic</c><00:00:27.599><c> and</c><00:00:27.689><c> I</c><00:00:27.779><c> would</c><00:00:27.869><c> be</c><00:00:27.960><c> really</c><00:00:28.170><c> cool</c>
