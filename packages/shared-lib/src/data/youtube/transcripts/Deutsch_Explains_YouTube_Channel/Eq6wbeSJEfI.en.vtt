allow any wiggle room therefore
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.390 align:start position:0%
allow any wiggle room therefore
everything<00:00:27.480><c> we</c><00:00:27.779><c> do</c><00:00:27.960><c> also</c><00:00:28.560><c> doesn't</c><00:00:28.859><c> allow</c><00:00:29.220><c> any</c>

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
everything we do also doesn't allow any

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
um an illusion now I think that's
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 align:start position:0%
um an illusion now I think that's
um<00:00:36.059><c> that's</c><00:00:36.660><c> that's</c><00:00:36.660><c> called</c><00:00:37.020><c> reductionism</c><00:00:37.760><c> and</c>

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
um that's that's called reductionism and
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
um that's that's called reductionism and
it<00:00:39.059><c> is</c><00:00:39.239><c> simply</c><00:00:39.719><c> a</c><00:00:40.020><c> mistake</c><00:00:40.520><c> uh</c><00:00:41.520><c> it's</c><00:00:41.820><c> it's</c><00:00:42.239><c> sort</c>

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
it is simply a mistake uh it's it's sort
