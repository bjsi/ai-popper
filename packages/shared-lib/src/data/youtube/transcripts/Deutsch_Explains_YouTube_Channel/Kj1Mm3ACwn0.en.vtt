like I can more easily answer the

kind<00:28:49.440><c> of</c><00:28:49.559><c> scientist</c><00:28:50.039><c> okay</c><00:28:51.059><c> um</c><00:28:51.179><c> then</c><00:28:51.360><c> I</c><00:28:51.539><c> would</c>

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of scientist okay um then I would
 

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.789 align:start position:0%
kind of scientist okay um then I would
be<00:28:51.720><c> a</c><00:28:51.840><c> film</c><00:28:51.960><c> director</c><00:28:52.380><c> yes</c><00:28:52.799><c> but</c><00:28:53.580><c> uh</c>

00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
be a film director yes but uh
 

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:58.970 align:start position:0%
be a film director yes but uh
think<00:28:56.580><c> it's</c><00:28:57.360><c> not</c><00:28:57.659><c> a</c><00:28:57.840><c> well-formed</c><00:28:58.440><c> question</c><00:28:58.679><c> in</c>

00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%

00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
the case of science because if I was
