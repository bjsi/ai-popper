00:00:09.908 --> 00:00:21.758
[Music]

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:29.618
thank you

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:40.898
[Music]

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:42.278
whoa

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:53.198
like immortality or perpetual motion time travel&nbsp;
is one of the enduring fantasies of the human race&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:58.238
but until recently The View held by&nbsp;
scientists has been that time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:02.018
is impossible not because there&nbsp;
is any law of physics forbidding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:06.818
it but because if it were possible it&nbsp;
would create all sorts of paradoxes

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:16.058
stand by for Time Travelers arriving I study&nbsp;
time travel as part of my work as a theoretical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:21.578
physicist I'm interested in anything that is&nbsp;
fundamental about the way the universe works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:26.858
I want to know the way things are and how&nbsp;
they behave at the deepest level possible

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:35.318
the Newtonian picture of the universe with its&nbsp;
mechanical view of time has been replaced by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:42.158
modern ideas of Relativity and quantum mechanics&nbsp;
prior to these time travel had seemed impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:47.558
however research being carried out&nbsp;
by physicists myself included has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:51.818
now shown that most of the objections to&nbsp;
time travel are not really obstacles at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:57.158
we may not be able to build a time machine&nbsp;
tomorrow but at least it now seems that building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:02.678
one would not be impossible in scientific&nbsp;
circles time travel has become respectable

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:12.938
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:13.478
together

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:21.698
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:29.258
as a theoretical physicist I spend a lot of&nbsp;
time just thinking ideal in ideas my laboratory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:35.798
is my home here in Oxford my equipment is a&nbsp;
personal computer a pencil and a piece of paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:42.098
I keep in touch with other scientists around&nbsp;
the world via electronic mail on my computer

00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:51.038
one of them is Frank tippler of Tulane University&nbsp;
in New Orleans he has been studying time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:59.798
since the early 1970s the simplest example of&nbsp;
time travel is what I'm doing now sitting in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:08.018
armchair I am now moving into the future a more&nbsp;
interesting example however of time travel was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:15.218
that conducted by two atomic clocks one stationary&nbsp;
in Washington DC and the other one traveling in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:22.658
airplane to Europe and back the clock which&nbsp;
traveled on the airplane which accelerated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:30.818
actually went through less time than&nbsp;
the clock which was stationary so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.818 --> 00:03:35.618
the clock that moved moved into the&nbsp;
future of the clock that stayed home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:44.318
Einstein's special theory of relativity predicts&nbsp;
exactly what happens to moving clocks if somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:49.598
the airplane had been moving faster than the speed&nbsp;
of light then it could have traveled into the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:55.778
unfortunately the same Theory also predicts&nbsp;
that it takes an infinite amount of energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.778 --> 00:04:02.078
even to reach the speed of light therefore simply&nbsp;
increasing your speed is useless for time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:11.018
into the past [Music] atomic clocks and armchairs&nbsp;
are not what we normally think of when we speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:17.618
of time travel what usually Springs to mind is&nbsp;
traveling far forwards into the future or back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:24.098
into the past to see how this might be possible&nbsp;
we need to look at the physicist's picture of time

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:37.058
as H.G Wells wrote in his book The Time&nbsp;
Machine over a hundred years ago you must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:42.938
follow me carefully I shall have to controvert one&nbsp;
or two ideas that are almost universally accepted

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:59.078
there are really four dimensions three of which we&nbsp;
call the three planes of space and a fourth time

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.178
[Music]

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:18.158
our present view of time is captured in the&nbsp;
two great theories of modern physics quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:25.478
theory and Einstein's general relativity Chris&nbsp;
Isham is trying to link the two together in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:30.878
Einstein's picture of the universe space and time&nbsp;
are considered together as a single sort of block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:37.178
one of the most striking features of this&nbsp;
block Universe picture of space and time is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.178 --> 00:05:41.738
that there's a certain sense in which the past&nbsp;
and the present and the future all as it were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:45.578
exists at once they have the same sort of status&nbsp;
and of course if you're interested in something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:49.718
like time travel and I suppose it's a certain&nbsp;
sense which you want that to be true because if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.718 --> 00:05:53.378
you're going to go back into the past the past&nbsp;
had to some sense really be there to be real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.998 --> 00:06:00.698
from the point of view of modern physics space&nbsp;
and time are not independent entities but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:07.598
are linked together in an indissolvable hole&nbsp;
called space-time that means that it's not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:16.058
the present that exists the future also exists&nbsp;
the past also exists future and the past are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.058 --> 00:06:24.278
as real as the present from the point of view of&nbsp;
physics the dinosaurs exist even though there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:31.118
been no dinosaur on Earth for 70 million years&nbsp;
now listen to me when people think of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.118 --> 00:06:37.178
they think of it as death and something something&nbsp;
that happened long ago Greece Rome Carthage Egypt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:44.558
but when does it really begin well isn't&nbsp;
it obvious it begins an instant ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.758 --> 00:06:49.298
the dead past is just another&nbsp;
name for the living present

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:58.718
too many Einstein's view of space-time&nbsp;
is a difficult concept to grasp the idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:04.398
that our Destinies might be mapped out in&nbsp;
advance take some getting used to [Music]

00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:16.958
each instant in this horse's existence represents&nbsp;
an event in space-time and indicates where in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:24.338
universe the horse was at that moment the horse&nbsp;
traces out a line in space-time but because time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:30.218
isn't a separate entity space-time has a very&nbsp;
unusual feature in the space-time view of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.218 --> 00:07:38.858
world nothing moves there is no particular moment&nbsp;
called the present space-time shows the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:44.918
history past present and future in space-time&nbsp;
you can look at all times at the same time

00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:54.998
our perception of time is due to our&nbsp;
Consciousness moving up into the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:59.438
the future however is already there thank you

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:09.038
the space-time view links the past present and&nbsp;
future but it doesn't necessarily dictate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:14.078
order that they come in as a time traveler&nbsp;
you would see things happening in a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.078 --> 00:08:21.258
disconcerting way you could also expect to meet a&nbsp;
younger or even an older copy of yourself [Music]

00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:30.338
thank you

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:49.958
[Music]

00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.298
time travel is not about changing the&nbsp;
direction of time but about getting space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.298 --> 00:09:03.098
time itself to take you back into the past&nbsp;
if this is space-time and B is later than a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:10.238
then the only way of getting back to&nbsp;
a is if there's a loop in space-time

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:16.178
you're late I knew you would be

00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:21.098
sir I have a Time Quake approaching

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:40.298
a paradox Louise you've changed the past now you&nbsp;
know damn why we can't change the past it catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:47.018
up with us common argument against the possibility&nbsp;
of time travel is called the grandfather Paradox&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:56.378
the idea is this the time traveler gets in his&nbsp;
time machine he goes back into time he shoots to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.378 --> 00:10:03.638
death his grandfather before his grandfather has&nbsp;
a chance to Father his father therefore the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.638 --> 00:10:10.058
traveler cannot exist because his father never&nbsp;
existed therefore since the time traveler doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.058 --> 00:10:14.678
exist he can't go back into time and shoot&nbsp;
his grandfather we obviously have a logical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:21.338
contradiction many people have thought in the past&nbsp;
this has ruled out the possibility of time travel

00:10:21.338 --> 00:10:28.898
if it is possible to build a time machine&nbsp;
surely people in the future would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:32.918
used it to travel into the past but&nbsp;
since no one has seen any tourists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:37.658
from the future some take this as further&nbsp;
evidence that time travel is impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:42.938
although the grandfather Paradox would seem to&nbsp;
rule out time travel this is not the end of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.938 --> 00:10:47.918
story so far we have confined ourselves&nbsp;
to Einstein's view of space-time to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:53.498
why time travel is possible we have to take into&nbsp;
account the strange implications of quantum theory

00:11:07.438 --> 00:11:08.438
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.438 --> 00:11:14.318
at present our best theory of matter and&nbsp;
energy and indeed reality is quantum theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:18.878
at the most straightforward level this&nbsp;
allows us to predict how things like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.878
electrons atoms and light interact with each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.418 --> 00:11:27.278
for instance the transistors in your television&nbsp;
set were designed using quantum theory

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:37.838
quantum physics really is an extremely successful&nbsp;
Theory at describing whole Atomic physics and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:42.098
subatomic physics and all sorts of things in&nbsp;
daily life actually depend on quantum mechanics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.098 --> 00:11:47.678
the whole Communications industry television&nbsp;
sets radio sets digital wristwatch nuclear power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.678 --> 00:11:52.598
for that matter all these things are very much&nbsp;
quantum mechanical and as part of the theory have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.598 --> 00:11:56.858
been tested to a phenomenal degree of accuracy one&nbsp;
part in a billion that sort of that sort of side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:02.258
but also it must be said it has some very peculiar&nbsp;
features about the picture of reality which it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:08.558
portrays in my most recent work I have been&nbsp;
looking at how quantum theory could be applied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:13.718
to a hypothetical computer which calculated&nbsp;
according to the principles of quantum mechanics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.258 --> 00:12:17.798
I did a calculation assuming&nbsp;
that time travel was possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:22.538
as part of that calculation I took&nbsp;
information from the output of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:28.718
quantum computer and fed it to the input before&nbsp;
it had even left the output now if time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:33.398
into the past was impossible the result of my&nbsp;
calculation should have been a contradiction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:41.258
I'd expected a paradox but surprisingly I didn't&nbsp;
find one time and again my results showed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.258 --> 00:12:47.978
nothing bad happens if information goes back into&nbsp;
the past it all works perfectly and if information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:53.018
can do it there's no theoretical reason why&nbsp;
human beings couldn't time travel as well

00:12:53.018 --> 00:13:06.398
[Music]

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:19.778
[Music]

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:25.238
it was quantum theory that allowed the message&nbsp;
in my quantum computer to go back in time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:31.238
the explanation for why this is possible&nbsp;
relies on one of the most bizarre ideas of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:37.298
quantum theory the many worlds interpretation&nbsp;
well the many world's interpretation of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.298 --> 00:13:42.038
quantum mechanism is very peculiar in the&nbsp;
following respect that first of all one has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:45.998
to say that all of quantum mechanics deals with&nbsp;
probabilities of things happening which is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.998 --> 00:13:50.078
tossing a coin he says there's the fundamental&nbsp;
property of nature now when you actually toss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.078 --> 00:13:54.398
a coin of course usually it does that it&nbsp;
comes down heads or tails now there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:58.718
many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics&nbsp;
is when you come to the analogous operation in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.718 --> 00:14:03.458
quantum theory there is a real sense in&nbsp;
which both possibilities actually occur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:09.218
so rather than doing either this or that you&nbsp;
get both and these are thought of sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.218 --> 00:14:15.218
as being therefore different worlds it is as if&nbsp;
you like the universe as a branched or split at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:20.078
that point into the two copies of itself one way&nbsp;
has come up heads one where it's come up Tails

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:29.858
taken literally the equations of quantum&nbsp;
mechanics say that each time the pinball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.858 --> 00:14:35.798
hits a bumper it bounces off in all possible&nbsp;
directions consequently the ball follows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.798 --> 00:14:43.118
many different lines in space-time all of which&nbsp;
actually happen but if all these life histories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:49.118
are actually happening the obvious questions&nbsp;
are where are they and why do we see only one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:53.798
well according to the many worlds&nbsp;
interpretation all the life histories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.798 --> 00:14:58.658
do actually happen but each occurs&nbsp;
in its own separate parallel universe

00:15:01.058 --> 00:15:04.538
we only ever see one Universe because there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:08.618
almost no communication between the&nbsp;
parallel universes they each proceed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.618 --> 00:15:14.018
on their independent ways along with their&nbsp;
copies of you me the pinball and the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:22.118
what holds for the pinball machine holds for the&nbsp;
universe as a whole reality then does not consist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.118 --> 00:15:29.438
of one universe but of a Multiverse comprising a&nbsp;
large number of broadly similar parallel universes

00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.738
the many world's interpretation of quantum&nbsp;
physics is one of these things that generates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:41.018
intense emotion month threat or physicists some&nbsp;
are very much in favor some very much against but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:45.638
there is one domain of physics where it's almost&nbsp;
I think obligatory and that's Quantum cosmology

00:15:51.758 --> 00:15:58.118
cosmologists use quantum theory to study the&nbsp;
way space and time behave from the creation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.118 --> 00:16:06.158
the universe onwards they rely on the many worlds&nbsp;
interpretation in their calculations [Music] the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:12.098
mini world's interpretation of quantum mechanics&nbsp;
sounds completely bizarre even to most physicists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.098 --> 00:16:18.578
it seems absolutely crazy that there could be&nbsp;
other copies of ourselves out there with which we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:26.018
could never interact and never see however there&nbsp;
is one field of physics in which the majority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:32.798
of practitioners believe in the many worlds&nbsp;
interpretation that's Quantum cosmology a poll was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.798 --> 00:16:41.498
conducted amongst the leading Quantum cosmologists&nbsp;
in the world and an overwhelming majority of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.498 --> 00:16:46.178
people said that they believed in the many&nbsp;
worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:51.158
field equations of quantum cosmology forces&nbsp;
to believe in the many worlds interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.158 --> 00:16:55.898
not quite clear this is I can see by your face&nbsp;
that you're not certain you don't understand

00:17:06.878 --> 00:17:11.978
it's part of the normal process of science to&nbsp;
be deeply skeptical of radical new theories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.638 --> 00:17:18.278
but it's wrong for scientists not to take a&nbsp;
theory seriously just because it seems outrageous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:25.118
360 years ago the Inquisition&nbsp;
threatened Galileo with torture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.118 --> 00:17:27.518
because he claimed that the Earth was rotating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:34.298
to the Inquisition it was obvious from personal&nbsp;
experience that the Earth doesn't move but here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.298 --> 00:17:40.358
at the science museum the slow turning of this&nbsp;
Foucault Pendulum shows that Galileo was right

00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:48.758
in everyday situations it doesn't matter whether&nbsp;
the existence of parallel universes is taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.758 --> 00:17:53.738
seriously just as it doesn't matter whether&nbsp;
the rotation of the earth is taken seriously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.738 --> 00:18:00.818
but some Concepts like time travel only make&nbsp;
sense if the parallel universes really do exist

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:12.158
one person who is not convinced&nbsp;
by these ideas is Stephen Hawking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.938 --> 00:18:16.778
he is recently proposed a new&nbsp;
law of physics which says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.778 --> 00:18:21.458
time travel is impossible he calls it&nbsp;
the chronology protection principle

00:18:27.698 --> 00:18:35.558
were warped and distorted by the matter and energy&nbsp;
in the universe that might therefore be possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:42.098
that they could be warped so much that you could&nbsp;
go on a journey and come back before you set out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:51.338
this could cause all sorts of problems perhaps&nbsp;
fortunately it seems there may be a chronology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:58.298
protection principle which prevents travel into&nbsp;
the past and so means that we don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.298 --> 00:19:05.738
rewrite the history books what seems to happen is&nbsp;
that when space-time gets near to allowing travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:12.578
into the past a large number of particles appear&nbsp;
on these prevent one warping space-time anymore

00:19:14.378 --> 00:19:21.338
the existence of the chronology protection&nbsp;
principle is supported by theoretical work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:29.318
that I and other people have done Stephen Hawking&nbsp;
has defended recently what he calls the chronology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.318 --> 00:19:36.938
protection conjecture that says time travel&nbsp;
is absolutely impossible I think he's wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.598 --> 00:19:42.878
I think that looking carefully at&nbsp;
the detailed arguments which people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.878 --> 00:19:49.118
have produced indicates that it's quite&nbsp;
plausible a time machine can be constructed

00:19:49.718 --> 00:19:58.178
at the Paradox of time travel arose because it&nbsp;
was assumed you traveled back to the same universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.318 --> 00:20:04.178
but what if we didn't go back to the&nbsp;
same universe we started from what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:06.818
if we went back to one of the parallel universes

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:16.478
in our original Time Machine model the&nbsp;
space-time Loop took us back into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.478 --> 00:20:22.958
past in the same universe quantum theory says&nbsp;
that there are many parallel universes our Loop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:28.478
instead of joining back onto the same universe&nbsp;
links up at an earlier time with one of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:34.058
parallel universes a traveler who enters the&nbsp;
time machine in one universe will not only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.058 --> 00:20:40.958
end up at an earlier time but also in a different&nbsp;
universe one of the consequences of this movement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:45.578
is that you could meet up with the copies of&nbsp;
yourself who live in the parallel universes

00:20:55.118 --> 00:21:03.098
thank you dudes you guys are gonna go&nbsp;
back in time yeah you are going to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.098 --> 00:21:09.098
the most excellent adventure through&nbsp;
history who are you guys were you dude

00:21:17.758 --> 00:21:18.758
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:24.998
suppose I do an experiment with this time machine&nbsp;
I will travel through Quantum space time back a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.998 --> 00:21:32.918
few minutes into the past to test the Paradox I&nbsp;
will shoot my slightly younger self let's look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:40.118
at only two of the many parallel universes in the&nbsp;
left-hand Universe I decide to go into the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.118 --> 00:21:48.038
machine and travel back in time to the right hand&nbsp;
Universe just before I set off so long partner

00:21:50.198 --> 00:21:53.198
Paradox is avoided because when I traveled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.198 --> 00:21:58.238
in time I also traveled into another&nbsp;
Universe where I shot a copy of myself

00:22:03.718 --> 00:22:04.718
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.718 --> 00:22:10.778
General universe and shot me and so I&nbsp;
was free to travel and no Paradox arises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.158 --> 00:22:20.558
passports please moving ahead to February 12 1999&nbsp;
but what about the other objection to time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:25.598
how do we explain the fact that we have not been&nbsp;
invaded by hordes of tourists from the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.498 --> 00:22:34.478
one of the properties of a time machine is that&nbsp;
you can never visit a time which is earlier than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:42.098
the moment The Time Machine came into existence&nbsp;
for instance if a time machine is created and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.698 --> 00:22:50.978
um the 21st century then it will be impossible for&nbsp;
visitors in the far future to visit us they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:57.098
visit the 21st century but not us in particular&nbsp;
creating a time machine will not make it possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.098 --> 00:23:04.238
for us to see the dinosaurs however if another&nbsp;
Advanced civilization created many hundreds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.238 --> 00:23:10.358
millions of years ago a time machine it&nbsp;
would be possible to visit the dinosaurs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.738 --> 00:23:16.478
so if you want to meet your own distant&nbsp;
ancestors you'll either have to find a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:20.738
naturally occurring time machine somewhere&nbsp;
in the universe or borrow a time machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.738 --> 00:23:27.818
created in the past by an extraterrestrial&nbsp;
civilization before anyone claims that UFOs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:34.898
are visitors from the future let me say that I&nbsp;
think any special in visitation would be much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.898 --> 00:23:41.558
more obvious and probably much more unpleasant&nbsp;
let me get this straight a thing that looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.558 --> 00:23:47.178
like a police box standing in a junkyard it&nbsp;
can move anywhere in time and space [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.838 --> 00:23:55.118
Doctor Who's Tardis is perhaps the best known&nbsp;
visualization of a time machine but there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.118 --> 00:23:59.618
been no shortage of imaginative ideas about&nbsp;
what a practical time machine would look like

00:24:19.378 --> 00:24:20.378
[Music]

00:24:20.378 --> 00:24:30.338
according to general relativity gravity is a&nbsp;
manifestation of the warping of space and time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.058 --> 00:24:36.458
matter tells space how to warp how to curve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.178 --> 00:24:47.078
if you have very massive body which is rotating&nbsp;
then the rotation and massiveness of the body can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:53.798
twist space and time so drastically&nbsp;
that near the rapidly rotating body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.338 --> 00:25:01.298
the future Direction actually points into the&nbsp;
past from the point of view of us here on Earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:09.758
if such a body actually exists in space that&nbsp;
rapidly rotating body would be a time machine

00:25:13.358 --> 00:25:23.138
rotating black holes have perhaps in their&nbsp;
interior regions where time and space are twisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:23.138 --> 00:25:33.338
around in just the way I have described that the&nbsp;
future points into the past however this would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.338 --> 00:25:39.638
useless to create a time machine because you could&nbsp;
never get outside of the black hole once you fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:46.358
inside if skirting close to a black hole sounds a&nbsp;
little uncomfortable there is another possibility

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:55.118
one of the key ingredient in time travel is a&nbsp;
tear being set up in space time now you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.118 --> 00:26:00.218
do this in ordinary classical general relativity&nbsp;
you can have smooth bends in space and time you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:00.218 --> 00:26:05.738
can't rip it apart in the quantum theory you&nbsp;
find that these bends and warps can fluctuate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:10.598
and they can become contorted in such a way&nbsp;
that you can actually punch through and change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:10.598 --> 00:26:14.498
what's technical with an apology of space&nbsp;
so for example you go from a smooth surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.498 --> 00:26:17.918
or something like the surface of a donut so it&nbsp;
twists in on itself now an interesting question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:17.918 --> 00:26:24.098
is how big can you make that Loop the original&nbsp;
studies tried to say could be a large scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.098 --> 00:26:28.178
so you really could go back and see your&nbsp;
grandfather but the more recent ideas early&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.178 --> 00:26:32.918
Visa effects would take place at these very very&nbsp;
tiny distances which you get in quantum gravity

00:26:35.558 --> 00:26:40.058
at the moment all routes to time travel are&nbsp;
far beyond our technological capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:44.018
but more physicists than ever&nbsp;
are doing research in this area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:44.558 --> 00:26:49.658
and all the traditional objections to&nbsp;
time travel have turned out to be invalid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.658 --> 00:26:56.198
my gut feeling is that if technological obstacles&nbsp;
are the only ones in our way then one day time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:56.198 --> 00:27:03.038
machines will be built it will be a Pity if&nbsp;
it turns out that time travel is not possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.778 --> 00:27:10.178
it would have been exciting to explore&nbsp;
the universe in time as well as space

00:27:12.218 --> 00:27:16.598
well the subtle time travel is certainly very&nbsp;
very speculative as indeed is the whole issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.598 --> 00:27:21.758
how you combine quantum theory general relativity&nbsp;
but in these sorts of topics ever far they may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.758 --> 00:27:26.738
appear to be even ordinary daily common sense&nbsp;
you really are trying to address the fundamental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.738 --> 00:27:31.358
ingredients of reality the really sort of basic&nbsp;
physical level in that sense I think it is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:35.198
important program and well worth pursuing&nbsp;
even though it is I say very speculative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.118 --> 00:27:44.318
my personal belief is that we know nothing&nbsp;
to definitely rule out the possibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.318 --> 00:27:51.278
time travel we've been doing intensive research&nbsp;
on this subject for many years and we studied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:51.278 --> 00:27:57.738
carefully laws of physics we see no reason for&nbsp;
thinking that time travel is forbidden [Music]

00:28:07.298 --> 00:28:12.638
almost all of the discussion about time travel is&nbsp;
beyond the present realm of experimental testing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:13.178 --> 00:28:18.518
but I have faith in the theory and time&nbsp;
travel is allowed by the theory maybe I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:18.518 --> 00:28:31.448
an optimist but there's an old saying in physics&nbsp;
whatever is not forbidden is compulsory [Music]

00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:39.038
[Music]

00:28:39.038 --> 00:28:45.738
now you always say that you wanna be free [Music]

00:29:06.158 --> 00:29:09.878
next week in antenna Professor Bob&nbsp;
Williamson explores what has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:09.878 --> 00:29:12.398
described as the next revolution in medicine Gene
