so<00:00:38.579><c> um</c><00:00:38.700><c> you</c><00:00:39.239><c> know</c><00:00:39.300><c> I</c><00:00:39.420><c> talk</c><00:00:39.600><c> in</c><00:00:39.780><c> the</c><00:00:39.899><c> book</c><00:00:40.079><c> about</c>

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
so um you know I talk in the book about
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 align:start position:0%
so um you know I talk in the book about
things<00:00:41.160><c> like</c><00:00:41.520><c> traveling</c><00:00:42.180><c> to</c><00:00:42.420><c> Intergalactic</c>

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
things like traveling to Intergalactic
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.709 align:start position:0%
things like traveling to Intergalactic
space<00:00:43.379><c> which</c><00:00:43.980><c> will</c><00:00:44.579><c> no</c><00:00:44.760><c> doubt</c><00:00:45.000><c> not</c><00:00:45.180><c> happen</c><00:00:45.420><c> for</c>

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
space which will no doubt not happen for
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.410 align:start position:0%
space which will no doubt not happen for
thousands<00:00:46.079><c> of</c><00:00:46.200><c> years</c><00:00:46.379><c> yet</c><00:00:46.739><c> but</c>

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
thousands of years yet but
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
thousands of years yet but
um<00:00:48.480><c> it</c><00:00:48.840><c> would</c><00:00:48.899><c> be</c><00:00:49.079><c> very</c><00:00:49.379><c> surprising</c><00:00:50.180><c> if</c><00:00:51.180><c> death</c>

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
um it would be very surprising if death
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 align:start position:0%
um it would be very surprising if death
in<00:00:52.379><c> that</c><00:00:52.500><c> sense</c><00:00:52.800><c> were</c><00:00:53.340><c> not</c><00:00:53.640><c> conquered</c><00:00:54.180><c> in</c><00:00:54.480><c> the</c>

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
in that sense were not conquered in the
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500 align:start position:0%
in that sense were not conquered in the
next<00:00:54.719><c> few</c><00:00:54.960><c> centuries</c>
