00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.329 align:start position:0%
and so what you do if you adopt that
idea<00:12:25.920><c> is</c><00:12:26.339><c> is</c><00:12:26.640><c> you</c><00:12:27.540><c> try</c><00:12:27.779><c> to</c><00:12:27.959><c> reach</c><00:12:28.740><c> into</c><00:12:29.040><c> your</c>

00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
idea is is you try to reach into your

idea is is you try to reach into your
feelings<00:12:29.760><c> and</c><00:12:30.600><c> follow</c><00:12:30.779><c> them</c>

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
feelings and follow them

now<00:12:32.480><c> this</c><00:12:33.480><c> course</c><00:12:33.779><c> it's</c><00:12:34.560><c> impossible</c><00:12:35.100><c> uh</c><00:12:36.060><c> I</c>

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
now this course it's impossible uh I

um uh
 

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.590 align:start position:0%

so<00:13:15.240><c> that</c><00:13:15.480><c> is</c><00:13:15.660><c> irrational</c><00:13:16.139><c> for</c><00:13:16.620><c> for</c><00:13:16.680><c> for</c><00:13:17.420><c> uh</c><00:13:18.420><c> I</c>

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
so that is irrational for for for uh I
 

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
so that is irrational for for for uh I
mean<00:13:18.720><c> it's</c><00:13:18.959><c> overtly</c><00:13:19.500><c> irrational</c>

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
mean it's overtly irrational
 

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.690 align:start position:0%

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
um but there's also the problem just
 

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
um but there's also the problem just
