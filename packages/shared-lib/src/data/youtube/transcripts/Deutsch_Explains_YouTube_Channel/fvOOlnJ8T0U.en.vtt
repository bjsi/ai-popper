they're simply wrong or this well
they're<00:21:32.159><c> all</c><00:21:32.280><c> wrong</c><00:21:32.460><c> in</c><00:21:32.640><c> different</c><00:21:32.820><c> ways</c><00:21:33.240><c> but</c>

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're all wrong in different ways but
 

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.430 align:start position:0%
they're all wrong in different ways but
yes

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%

well I'm going to ask David about
 

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.210 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to ask David about
something<00:21:45.240><c> that</c><00:21:45.480><c> I</c><00:21:45.659><c> think</c><00:21:45.780><c> he</c><00:21:46.020><c> thinks</c>

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
something that I think he thinks
 

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.529 align:start position:0%
something that I think he thinks

00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
uh
 

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:50.750 align:start position:0%

in this
 

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.330 align:start position:0%
in this
would<00:21:51.240><c> you</c><00:21:51.419><c> describe</c><00:21:51.780><c> yourself</c><00:21:51.900><c> as</c><00:21:52.500><c> as</c><00:21:53.039><c> a</c>

would you describe yourself as as a

okay<00:21:56.460><c> well</c><00:21:57.120><c> I</c><00:21:57.659><c> used</c><00:21:57.840><c> to</c><00:21:57.960><c> be</c><00:21:58.080><c> a</c><00:21:58.200><c> technological</c>

00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay well I used to be a technological
 

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay well I used to be a technological
Optimist<00:21:59.340><c> but</c><00:22:00.240><c> I</c><00:22:00.539><c> then</c><00:22:01.220><c> started</c><00:22:02.220><c> studying</c><00:22:02.520><c> a</c>

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
little bit cosmology and maybe thinking
 

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.950 align:start position:0%

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that's okay because they're
