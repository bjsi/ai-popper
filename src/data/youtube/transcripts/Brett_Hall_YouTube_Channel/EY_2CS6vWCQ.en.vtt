therefore their luminosity is precisely

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
question what would it be and it was
 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.510 align:start position:0%
question what would it be and it was
this<00:07:24.400><c> one</c><00:07:24.800><c> it</c><00:07:24.880><c> was</c><00:07:25.120><c> about</c><00:07:25.759><c> dark</c><00:07:26.240><c> energy</c><00:07:27.039><c> and</c>

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
this one it was about dark energy and
 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
this one it was about dark energy and
today<00:07:28.160><c> october</c><00:07:28.639><c> 27th</c><00:07:29.280><c> happens</c><00:07:29.599><c> to</c><00:07:29.680><c> be</c><00:07:29.840><c> his</c>
