00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the one where it ends
 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the one where it ends
up<00:08:42.240><c> but</c><00:08:42.399><c> that</c><00:08:42.640><c> doesn't</c><00:08:42.880><c> mean</c><00:08:43.039><c> you</c><00:08:43.120><c> can</c><00:08:43.360><c> explain</c>

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
up but that doesn't mean you can explain
 

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
up but that doesn't mean you can explain
what's<00:08:44.080><c> going</c><00:08:44.320><c> on</c><00:08:44.480><c> in</c><00:08:44.560><c> the</c><00:08:44.720><c> trick</c>

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the trick
 

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.910 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the trick
yeah<00:08:45.920><c> so</c><00:08:46.320><c> yeah</c><00:08:46.640><c> exactly</c><00:08:47.279><c> so</c><00:08:47.440><c> you</c><00:08:47.680><c> you</c><00:08:47.839><c> can</c>

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah exactly so you you can
 

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah exactly so you you can
predict<00:08:48.399><c> quite</c><00:08:48.640><c> confidently</c><00:08:49.440><c> that</c><00:08:49.600><c> the</c><00:08:49.760><c> ball</c>

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
predict quite confidently that the ball
 

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
predict quite confidently that the ball
isn't<00:08:50.320><c> there</c>

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
isn't there
 

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.310 align:start position:0%
isn't there
and<00:08:51.519><c> there</c><00:08:51.760><c> you</c><00:08:51.920><c> are</c><00:08:52.080><c> it's</c><00:08:52.240><c> vindicated</c><00:08:53.040><c> he</c><00:08:53.760><c> uh</c>

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
and there you are it's vindicated he uh
 

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
and there you are it's vindicated he uh
but

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
but
 

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
but
that's<00:08:54.880><c> not</c><00:08:55.120><c> what</c><00:08:55.360><c> you</c><00:08:55.680><c> mean</c><00:08:56.399><c> by</c><00:08:57.040><c> how</c><00:08:57.279><c> is</c><00:08:57.440><c> the</c>

that's not what you mean by how is the
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.389 align:start position:0%
that's not what you mean by how is the
