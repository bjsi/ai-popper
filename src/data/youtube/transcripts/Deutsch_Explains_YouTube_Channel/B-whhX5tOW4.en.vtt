00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
fully agreed because we need to do that
 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.010 align:start position:0%

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and we just need to close the gap
 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.270 align:start position:0%
um and we just need to close the gap

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.510 align:start position:0%
would not be having this conversation or

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
make the argument that you just made it
 

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.370 align:start position:0%
make the argument that you just made it
it<00:07:35.400><c> would</c><00:07:35.580><c> have</c><00:07:35.759><c> to</c><00:07:35.880><c> say</c><00:07:36.120><c> I've</c><00:07:36.960><c> only</c><00:07:37.199><c> got</c>

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
it would have to say I've only got
 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.650 align:start position:0%
it would have to say I've only got

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.129 align:start position:0%
so and I guess that will always be true
yeah<00:07:46.319><c> but</c><00:07:46.620><c> there's</c><00:07:47.340><c> something</c><00:07:47.580><c> in</c><00:07:47.880><c> in</c><00:07:48.479><c> um</c><00:07:48.479><c> in</c>

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
yeah but there's something in in um in
 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.510 align:start position:0%
yeah but there's something in in um in

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.030 align:start position:0%

example is of of dinosaurs in the past
 

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.050 align:start position:0%
example is of of dinosaurs in the past
so<00:13:41.700><c> there</c><00:13:42.480><c> are</c><00:13:42.660><c> people</c><00:13:42.899><c> who</c><00:13:43.260><c> say</c><00:13:43.760><c> nobody</c><00:13:44.760><c> ever</c>

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
so there are people who say nobody ever
 

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.170 align:start position:0%
so there are people who say nobody ever

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
saw a dinosaur nobody ever will and

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
therefore it's just a frivolity to say
 

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.389 align:start position:0%
therefore it's just a frivolity to say

there is no experimental way of
