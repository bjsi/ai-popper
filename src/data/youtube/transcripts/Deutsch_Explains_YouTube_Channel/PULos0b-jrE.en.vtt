so<00:07:50.699><c> I</c><00:07:50.940><c> thought</c><00:07:51.120><c> about</c><00:07:51.300><c> it</c><00:07:51.599><c> and</c><00:07:52.080><c> this</c><00:07:52.319><c> this</c><00:07:52.560><c> is</c>

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
so I thought about it and this this is
 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.189 align:start position:0%
so I thought about it and this this is
indeed<00:07:53.400><c> one</c><00:07:53.759><c> of</c><00:07:53.940><c> the</c><00:07:54.180><c> few</c><00:07:54.360><c> things</c><00:07:54.660><c> that</c><00:07:54.900><c> I</c><00:07:55.080><c> will</c>

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
indeed one of the few things that I will
 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.010 align:start position:0%
indeed one of the few things that I will

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 align:start position:0%

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.290 align:start position:0%
acknowledge is kind of a a bit of an

exactly makes the difference and I
 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.089 align:start position:0%
exactly makes the difference and I

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
thought of some examples such as the
 

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.370 align:start position:0%
thought of some examples such as the

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
explanation of the seasons as opposed to
 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.830 align:start position:0%
explanation of the seasons as opposed to

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
predicting them and then I I think that
 

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
predicting them and then I I think that
the<00:08:13.080><c> example</c><00:08:13.440><c> that</c><00:08:13.620><c> I</c><00:08:13.979><c> like</c><00:08:14.160><c> best</c><00:08:14.599><c> although</c>

but that doesn't mean you can explain
what's<00:08:44.339><c> going</c><00:08:44.520><c> on</c><00:08:44.640><c> in</c><00:08:44.820><c> the</c><00:08:45.000><c> trick</c><00:08:45.180><c> yeah</c><00:08:46.020><c> yeah</c>

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the trick yeah yeah
 

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.889 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the trick yeah yeah
exactly<00:08:47.339><c> so</c><00:08:47.700><c> you</c><00:08:47.880><c> you</c><00:08:48.060><c> can</c><00:08:48.240><c> predict</c><00:08:48.540><c> quite</c>

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
exactly so you you can predict quite
 

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.410 align:start position:0%
exactly so you you can predict quite
confidently<00:08:49.440><c> that</c><00:08:49.860><c> the</c><00:08:50.040><c> ball</c><00:08:50.160><c> isn't</c><00:08:50.580><c> there</c>

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
confidently that the ball isn't there
 

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
confidently that the ball isn't there
and<00:08:52.019><c> there</c><00:08:52.140><c> you</c><00:08:52.320><c> are</c><00:08:52.440><c> it's</c><00:08:52.620><c> Vindicated</c><00:08:53.160><c> he</c><00:08:53.760><c> uh</c>

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
and there you are it's Vindicated he uh
 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
and there you are it's Vindicated he uh
but<00:08:54.959><c> that's</c><00:08:55.260><c> not</c><00:08:55.500><c> what</c><00:08:55.800><c> you</c><00:08:56.040><c> mean</c><00:08:56.399><c> by</c><00:08:57.180><c> how</c><00:08:57.600><c> is</c>

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
but that's not what you mean by how is
 

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.350 align:start position:0%
but that's not what you mean by how is
the<00:08:57.959><c> trick</c><00:08:58.200><c> done</c><00:08:58.500><c> what</c><00:08:58.920><c> what</c><00:08:59.160><c> you</c><00:08:59.580><c> what</c><00:09:00.180><c> you</c>

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
the trick done what what you what you
 

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.290 align:start position:0%
the trick done what what you what you
mean<00:09:00.600><c> is</c><00:09:01.160><c> what</c><00:09:02.160><c> has</c><00:09:02.279><c> happened</c><00:09:02.519><c> to</c><00:09:02.760><c> bring</c><00:09:03.060><c> about</c>

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
mean is what has happened to bring about
 

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.150 align:start position:0%
mean is what has happened to bring about
the<00:09:03.899><c> thing</c><00:09:04.019><c> you</c><00:09:04.260><c> saw</c>

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
the thing you saw
 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
the thing you saw
and<00:09:05.640><c> so</c><00:09:05.820><c> you're</c><00:09:06.120><c> not</c><00:09:06.360><c> asking</c><00:09:07.019><c> for</c><00:09:07.560><c> an</c><00:09:07.800><c> account</c>

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so you're not asking for an account
 

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.670 align:start position:0%
and so you're not asking for an account
of<00:09:08.339><c> the</c><00:09:08.580><c> thing</c><00:09:08.820><c> you</c><00:09:09.120><c> saw</c><00:09:09.420><c> even</c><00:09:10.140><c> a</c><00:09:10.440><c> perfect</c>

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the thing you saw even a perfect
 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.190 align:start position:0%
of the thing you saw even a perfect
prediction<00:09:11.220><c> of</c><00:09:11.459><c> the</c><00:09:11.700><c> thing</c><00:09:11.940><c> you</c><00:09:12.240><c> saw</c><00:09:12.420><c> you're</c>

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
prediction of the thing you saw you're
 

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.050 align:start position:0%
prediction of the thing you saw you're
asking<00:09:13.560><c> about</c><00:09:13.740><c> the</c><00:09:14.100><c> thing</c><00:09:14.279><c> you</c><00:09:14.519><c> didn't</c><00:09:14.700><c> see</c>

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
asking about the thing you didn't see
 

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
asking about the thing you didn't see
yes<00:09:16.019><c> yes</c><00:09:16.380><c> and</c><00:09:17.040><c> this</c><00:09:17.220><c> comes</c><00:09:17.519><c> up</c><00:09:17.640><c> so</c><00:09:18.000><c> often</c><00:09:18.360><c> in</c>

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes yes and this comes up so often in
 

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.690 align:start position:0%
yes yes and this comes up so often in
all<00:09:19.260><c> throughout</c><00:09:19.620><c> the</c><00:09:19.800><c> book</c><00:09:19.980><c> really</c><00:09:20.220><c> and</c><00:09:20.519><c> I</c>

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
all throughout the book really and I
 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.690 align:start position:0%
all throughout the book really and I
think<00:09:20.760><c> it's</c><00:09:21.000><c> a</c><00:09:21.180><c> subtle</c><00:09:21.600><c> Point</c><00:09:22.279><c> easily</c><00:09:23.279><c> missed</c>

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
think it's a subtle Point easily missed
 

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.269 align:start position:0%
think it's a subtle Point easily missed
and<00:09:24.480><c> of</c><00:09:24.779><c> course</c><00:09:24.899><c> the</c><00:09:25.140><c> other</c><00:09:25.260><c> example</c><00:09:25.800><c> that</c><00:09:26.100><c> you</c>

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
and of course the other example that you
 

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.730 align:start position:0%
and of course the other example that you
use<00:09:26.459><c> and</c><00:09:26.640><c> that</c><00:09:26.820><c> you</c><00:09:27.000><c> often</c><00:09:27.240><c> go</c><00:09:27.420><c> to</c><00:09:27.540><c> is</c><00:09:28.019><c> this</c>

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
use and that you often go to is this
 

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.130 align:start position:0%
use and that you often go to is this
idea<00:09:28.980><c> of</c><00:09:29.160><c> dinosaurs</c><00:09:29.880><c> the</c><00:09:30.180><c> one</c><00:09:30.420><c> thing</c><00:09:30.660><c> that</c><00:09:30.959><c> you</c>

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
idea of dinosaurs the one thing that you
 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.190 align:start position:0%

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually can't observe is indeed the one
 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.870 align:start position:0%
actually can't observe is indeed the one

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
