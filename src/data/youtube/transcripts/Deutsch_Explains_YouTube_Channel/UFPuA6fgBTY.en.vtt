00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
what it means and then use what that
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.350 align:start position:0%
what it means and then use what that

and<00:00:38.040><c> with</c><00:00:38.239><c> luck</c><00:00:38.840><c> we</c><00:00:39.000><c> then</c><00:00:39.280><c> find</c><00:00:40.200><c> uh</c><00:00:40.320><c> a</c><00:00:40.520><c> way</c><00:00:40.800><c> of</c>

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
and with luck we then find uh a way of
