00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.870 align:start position:0%

and<00:06:16.020><c> So</c><00:06:16.320><c> the</c><00:06:16.740><c> faster</c><00:06:16.979><c> we</c><00:06:17.280><c> gain</c><00:06:17.460><c> new</c>

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
faster our predictions also improve and

faster our predictions also improve and

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
