there seem to be various levels of

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's the level that's to find out
 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.830 align:start position:0%
there's the level that's to find out

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
what laws laws the laws are and then
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.110 align:start position:0%
what laws laws the laws are and then

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's the level that is independent of

there's the level that is independent of
the<00:00:15.240><c> laws</c><00:00:15.559><c> so</c><00:00:15.679><c> we</c><00:00:15.799><c> know</c><00:00:16.000><c> that</c><00:00:16.119><c> Fermat's</c><00:00:16.640><c> Last</c>

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
the laws so we know that Fermat's Last
 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
the laws so we know that Fermat's Last
